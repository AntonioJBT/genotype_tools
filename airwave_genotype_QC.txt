Allele freq to test allele calling
Check expected distribution of genotypes



QC of markers first, then individual samples:

- GenomeStudio to plink, hg19 liftover, flip strand

              GH: here are the steps and tools for this task
              1) GenomeStudio to plink: by zcall script; already done
              2) convert from AB allele to illumina TOP/BOT annotation: by plink, using Wrayner's annotation files; I can do it
              3) hg19/build 37 liftover: by plink, using Wrayner's annotation files, also handles strand; I can do it

- Allele frequency report with proportions; 

- Select homogeneous set of samples to use as set for marker QC (PCA based, with automatic selection using e.g. 'aberrant' R package. This is to avoid artefacts from population structure. Excluded samples are later re-introduced.):
http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/1/134.full.pdf+html
Use summary statistics, and/or: missingness, ancestry, probe intensity, gender separately:
	- Merge plates first
	- Run PCA against 1000G (or Hapmap) as in UKB appendix 1 (requires using plink MAF >5%, HWE 10^-6, etc for Hapmap or 1000G, then projecting onto these)
	- aberrant with lambda set to 20 for ancestry PC1 and PC2 as summary stats

- Per batch marker QC (plink commands; drop failing SNPs from all plates):
     + Exclude monomorphic SNPs
     + Genotype call rate (<98%)
     + Genotype frequency consistency across batches (Fisher's exact test p-value <10^-12)
     + Allele frequency consistency versus reference panel (eg Hapmap, Fisher's exact test p-value <10^-12)
     + Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (p-value <10^-12)

- Plate/batch PCA (visual outlier detection check)

- Plate/batch merge

- Visual test of genotype calls in cluster plots (bin by MAF, pick random subset)

- Pooled sample QC (all samples; based on high quality set of markers from above; plink commands):

     + Run with autosomal SNPs only
     + Heterozygosity (standard deviation > +/- 3) and genotype failure rates per individual (>5%)
     + Relatedness between individuals (IBD cut-off >0.185)
     + Gender mis-identification check

- VCF check sanity (strand, problematic SNPs, etc.)

- Imputation + post-imputation QC (we can discuss this at a later stage)

- If several platforms, re-run whole script with each platform as separate batch

- Final set of QC'd and imputed individuals and markers can then be processed depending on specific question, eg:
     + Filter out MAF <1%
     + Ancestry PCA (e.g. vs Hapmap populations), filter out on PC2 values <0.072
     + Filter out mitochondrial and sex chromosomes

- VCF check sanity (strand, problematic SNPs, etc.)

Notes: 
- Plates 1-27 are batch 1, 28-53 are batch 2.
